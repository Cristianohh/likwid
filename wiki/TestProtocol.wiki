= Applications =

== likwid-topology ==

  # Call likwid-topology -h. Check all flags on correctness.
  # Call likwid-topology with all flag variants.
  # Test likwid-topology on:
    * Intel Core 2
    * Intel Nehalem EP (with and without SMT)
    * Intel Nehalem EX
    * AMD K8
    * AMD K10

== likwid-pin ==

  # Call likwid-pin -h. Check all flags on correctness.
  # Call likwid-pin with all flag variants.
  # Pin serial stream benchmark to process.
  # Pin threaded OpenMP stream benchmark to Sockets on NUMA machine (gcc, icc, skip mask). Check for scaling bandwidth.

== likwid-features ==


== likwid-perfCtr ==

  # Call likwid-perfCtr -h. Check all flags on correctness.
  # Call likwid-perfCtr with all flag variants.
  # Check all Performance groups on plausibility with likwid-bench on
    * Intel Core 2
    * Intel Nehalem EP
