SHORT Main memory bandwidth in MBytes/s

EVENTSET
UPMC0  UNC_DRAM_ACCESSES_DCT0_ALL
UPMC1  UNC_DRAM_ACCESSES_DCT1_ALL

METRICS
Memory bandwidth [MBytes/s]   1.0E-06*(UPMC0+UPMC1)*64.0/time

LONG
Formulas:
Memory bandwidth [MBytes/s] = 1.0E-06*(DRAM_ACCESSES_DCTO_ALL+DRAM_ACCESSES_DCT1_ALL)*64/time
-
Profiling group to measure memory bandwidth drawn by all cores of a socket.
Note: As this group measures the accesses from all cores it only makes sense
to measure with one core per socket, similiar as with the Intel Nehalem Uncore events.
